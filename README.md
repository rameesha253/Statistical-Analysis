📊 **Data Science Assignment – Exploratory & Inferential Analysis**

## **📌 Objective of This Repository**

The purpose of this repository is to share my Data Science assignment, which demonstrates my ability to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **statistical hypothesis testing** on a real-world dataset using Python.
This repository highlights my skills in:

* Analyzing and cleaning structured data
* Applying inferential statistics
* Using Python libraries for data visualization
* Drawing meaningful, data-backed insights
* Presenting results clearly through a Jupyter Notebook

This project is part of my academic work and also serves as a portfolio piece to showcase my data analysis capabilities.

## **🧠 Project Overview**

This project focuses on performing end-to-end data analysis to explore patterns, test hypotheses, and understand relationships in the dataset.
Key tasks performed include:

### 🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* Summary statistics (mean, median, std, distribution)
* Detecting missing values
* Outlier identification
* Comparing distributions across groups
* Understanding the structure of the dataset

### 📉 **Data Visualization**

* Histograms
* Boxplots
* Scatter plots
* Pairplots
* Correlation heatmaps
* Trend and category-based charts

### 📊 **Inferential Statistics**

* Formulating hypotheses
* Running statistical tests such as:

  * t-tests
  * ANOVA / Kruskal-Wallis
  * Chi-square tests
  * Confidence intervals
* Interpreting p-values and significance levels
* Supporting conclusions with visual and numerical evidence

### 📈 **Additional Techniques**

* Bootstrapping
* Sampling
* Comparing multiple independent groups
